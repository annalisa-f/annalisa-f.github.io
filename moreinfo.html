              <h4>Style & Inspirations</h4>
              <p>Frisky is a comedy drama that showcases rural New Zealand Relationships. It will have a simple and authentic
              visual style, with an emphasis on story.</p>
              <br>
              <p>It is inspired by Stevie's parents, with Anne and Mik being based on them. The plot is an imagining of how
              two people from such different backgrounds could have met, and realised that they could help each other.</p>

              <h4>Themes</h4>
              <h5>Mental Health</h5>
              <p>New Zealand has a terrible culture towards mental health. This is particularly bad in rural communities, and with
              older men. Our film is targeted at this audience, and shows Mik struggling and eventually admitting that he needs
              help. We aim to show this as being positive and important.</p>
              <br>
              <h5>Human Connection</h5>
              <p>Along similar lines, we see Mik isolated at the start of the film. This contributes to his issues and is causing
              him pain. Even Anne, who seems strong, is seeking connection, as it is something we all need to thrive.</p>
              <p>We also don't explicitly see their relationship become a romantic one. Neither Mik nor Anne specifically needs
              a romantic partner, just someone they can call up to be there for them.</p>
              <br>
              <h5>Gender Identity</h5>
              <p>We see Max, Anne's son, dressed in a tutu throughout the film. While Mik seems to be a somewhat steriotypical
              conservative farmer, we see him respond unexpectly and openly to Max's choice of outfit. This leads Anne to see
              that there may be more to Mik, and shows that anyone can have an open mind.</p>

              <h4>Audience</h4>
              <p>This film is aimed at older (and particularly rural) kiwis. There is a keen audience in that demographic who
              we know will enjoy our film.</p>
              <br>
              <p>We hope that we can share some of our vales with the audience through this, and connect generations.</p>
